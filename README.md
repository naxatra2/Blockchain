I have tried to create a blockchain using Javascript.
checklists:  
[x] Design the Blockchain Structure ( created classes for Block, Blockchain, Transactions and a hashing algorithm)
[x] Implement Block Creation and Chain Validation (Creating and validating each block that will be added in the blockchain)
[x] Implement Basic Consensus Algorithm (I have created functions to mine blocks and also give rewards miners)
[] Transaction Management
